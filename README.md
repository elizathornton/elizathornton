### About me

I am a physician who loves data science, programming, machine learning, and AI. After getting a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a Master's in Astronomy, I discovered a calling in medicine serving underserved and vulnerable populations. Since 2009, I have worked as a home-visiting primary care doctor, providing compassionate care to homebound elderly and disabled patients.  This github is a place for my projects for fun and learning.
